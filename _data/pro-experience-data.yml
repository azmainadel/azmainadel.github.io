#   description:  I worked with Young Bangla who launched a program with
#                 Microsoft Bangladesh to inspire the young developers to come up with something
#                 that would make a mark on the socio-economic state of Bangladesh.
#                 Working with a company with such an immense calibre taught me to surround myself 
#                 with people who push me to my limits.
