First things first, finding resources as a software developer or a CS student is tough. This doesn't mean that there aren't enough resources. Actually, there are way too many resources which can be overwhelming while searching for a library or tutorials or sample demo projects, etc.

GitHub is the best place for frameworks, libraries, projects, documentation, and collections of many things. 

Here I've listed some GitHub repos that might interest you. I've found these from reading articles, study purposes, suggestions from other people, random repo surfing adventure, and from the curiosity of learning new tools & frameworks. 

You can  learn and build new things, study for interviews and make yourself a better developer from these. This is not only for software developers, This is not only for software developers, but CS students can also gain something from this list. Hope this helps.
