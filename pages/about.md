### **A little bit about me**
Ever since I was a kid, computers have been my passion. I always remember the days of tweaking my old  PC by building custom OS using hack-tools. As the days past by, I went from editing the Windows registry to writing Javascript code snippets. I read books, all the articles in the newspapers I could find that were remotely related to computer hardware & software.

The passion carried me through my education in computer science at BUET. Even though I was somewhat average at academics, I learned about new languages, data structures, algorithms, compilers, software development, etc all with the same fascination I had as a kid.

The spark caught fire when I entered the industry. There is certainly yet more to learn, yet more to build and yet more problems to solve.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, maintaining design principles and writing optimized codes. 
So far I have Java, C++, C, Python, Javascript, Dart, GoLang, SQL, HTML, CSS, Flutter, Android SDK,  Blockchain, MongoDB, MySQL, Git under my belt. I am using my free time on AWS, Spring, Node.js, and enhancing my overall knowledge. I have somewhat worked on a professional level with UI design and graphic design with Photoshop, Illustrator, XD.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and remain up-to-date. I believe in professionalism and sincerity for a task. I prefer teamwork and knowledge sharing over being a lone wolf in the jungle.
