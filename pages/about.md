#### **A little bit about me**
Computers have been my passion since I was a kid. I have fond memories of tinkering with my old Intel Celeron PC, using hack tools to customize the operating system. Over time, my skills progressed from editing the Windows registry to writing JavaScript & Python code snippets. I eagerly consumed books and newspaper articles on computer hardware and software, devouring any information I could find.

My passion for computers guided my educational path, leading me to study Computer Science & Engineering at BUET. Although I was an average student academically, my fascination with new programming languages, data structures, algorithms, development frameworks, and tech tools grew stronger.

When I entered the industry, my passion truly ignited. I realized there was always more to learn, more to create, and more problems to solve.

I possess several strengths, including quickly learning new skills and programming languages, proficient problem-solving abilities, adherence to design principles, and writing optimized code. I continually strive to expand my knowledge in all areas. In addition to programming, I have experience in UI design and graphic design.

I have also been fortunate to participate in management and organizational roles. I have worked for and managed two non-profit organizations, and I have been a lead organizer for a national tech fest and other programs. I have also volunteered as a judge for multiple national hackathons.

I have a strong desire to stay updated with new technologies and continue learning. Professionalism and dedication are fundamental values that guide my work. I believe in the power of teamwork and knowledge sharing, rather than working alone in isolation.
