### **A little bit about me**
<p>
    I recently finished my graduation in computer science & engineering from BUET
    and started the marathon of software development & engineering in the industry.
</p>

<p>
    Worked on Android mobile app development, web development, desktop softwares,
    blockchains, digital system design, database management and UI/UX design.
    Interested in making maintainable and scalable softwares, algorithm engineering,
    advanced data structures, system design & security.
</p>

<p>
    Bogra born and bred.
    Loves movies with twists and that are aesthetic to the eyes.
    Listens to music without judging the genre.
    Never misses a chance to watch football and a Manchester United fanatic.
